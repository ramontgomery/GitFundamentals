# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:

```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./status.md),
[add](./Add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./push.md)

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
